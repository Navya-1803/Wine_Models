# 🍷 Wine Models

A machine learning project that explores various classification algorithms on the classic **Wine dataset**. This repository demonstrates model training, evaluation, and comparison using multiple supervised learning techniques.


## 📊 Dataset

- **Wine Dataset** from `sklearn.datasets`
- Contains chemical analysis of wines grown in the same region in Italy but derived from three different cultivars.
- 13 features, 3 classes


## 🧠 Models Implemented

This project implements and compares the following ML algorithms:

- ✅ Logistic Regression  
- ✅ K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)  
- ✅ Support Vector Machine (SVM)  
- ✅ Naive Bayes  
- ✅ Decision Tree  
- ✅ Random Forest  
- ✅ AdaBoost


## ⚙️ Features

- Train-test split using `train_test_split`
- Feature scaling with `StandardScaler`
- Model evaluation using:
  - Accuracy
  - Classification Report
  - Confusion Matrix
- Comparative analysis of model performance


## 🛠️ Libraries Used

```bash
numpy
pandas
scikit-learn
matplotlib
seaborn
